- 👋 Hi, I’m @nico-masi
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and I am a rising senior at my university.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic projects to develop my software engineering skills.
- I love listening to music and I will listen to anything I am sent because I think music helps you learn a bit more about someone.
- My main go tos are RnB, hiphop, and rap. I do love pop music, though!

Thanks for checking out my GitHub!
